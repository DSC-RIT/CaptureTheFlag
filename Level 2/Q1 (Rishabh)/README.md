# Level 2 Question 1

Note: Error - "It seems your browser does not support running Unity WebGL content from file:// urls. Please upload it to an http server, or try a different browser." 
In case of above error popping up while navigating to index.html page on any browser. Please download and use Mozilla Firefox then do the following 2 steps:
1) Type "about:config" in the navigation bar
2) Now type "privacy.file_unique_origin" and click that parameter to change it to "false"
This will run the game perfectly fine in Mozilla Firefox (Recommended)
