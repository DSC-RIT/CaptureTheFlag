    <title>Bobby's Front Yard</title>

    <h1>Howdy! Welcome to Bobby's Home</h1>
    <p>Its been years since he's cleaned this place up.</p>
    <p>
        Well this place is so old they still use IE haha. A mail to be recieved by you was accidentally delivered here
        He did get 2 modern looking keys packed together in something called "JS++" in the mail the other day, He
        thought it would be of no use since his garage's computer is so old, that all it runs is the oldest version of
        JS!
        So he didn't care too much about it and threw it somewhere in the garage. Later His son came in with a website
        on
        the "internet" which could convert "JS++" to JS so he could see what the 2 keys combined meant.</p>
    <p>
        But when Bobby told his son about what he did with they keys, his son began his search in the garage, only to
        find himself spending hours searching for it. Out of a fit of frustration, he too recklessly threw the link to
        the
        converter somewhere in the garage.
        You as a friendly neighbour, on the search of the 2 keys that were supposed to be delivered to you, are allowed
        to
        look
        into
        his garage to find them. All the best!
    </p>
