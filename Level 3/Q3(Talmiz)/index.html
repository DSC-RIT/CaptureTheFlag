    <title>Bobby's Front Yard</title>

    <h1>Howdy! Welcome to Bobby's Home</h1>
    <p>Its been years since he's cleaned this place up.</p>
    <p>
        Well this house is so old they still use IE haha. A mail to be recieved by you was accidentally delivered here
        He did get 2 modern looking keys packed together in something called "JS++" in the mail the other day, He
        thought it would be of no use since his garage's computer is so old, that all it runs is JS!
        So didn't care too much about it and threw it somewhere in the garage. Later His son came in with a website on
        the "internet" which could convert "JS++" to JS so he could see what the 2 keys meant.</p>
    <p>
        But when Bobby told his son about what he did with they keys, his son began his search in the garage, only to
        find himself spending hours finding it. Out of a fit of frustration, he too recklessly threw the link to the
        converter somewhere in the garage.
        You as a good citizen, on the search of the key that was supposed to be delivered to you, are allowed to look
        into
        his garage to find them. All the best!
    </p>

    // concatenation of the 2 keys is your answer!
