* Step 1: First thing we see is 'find the route back to home', so go '/home'
* Step 2: Exploring this page, go to 'Applications' pane in developer tools, under session storage, we see there is an example
* Step 3: We see that the magic function applied to those 2 arrays gives us output 'EXAMPLE'
* Step 4: Looking further, in cookies, we find a hint that says 'GATES'
* Step 5: Going back to the EXAMPLE, and trying some logic gates on the 2 input arrays, we find that XOR gate gives us the exact answer
* Step 6: Go back to the '/Question' route, apply element by element XOR to the 2 arrays, and you'll get your answer
